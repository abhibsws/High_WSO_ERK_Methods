## Authors: Abhijit Biswas, David Ketcheson, Steven Roberts, Benjamin Seibold, and David Shirokoff

#### This repository contains all the code used to generate the figures in the manuscript https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02817. To reproduce the figures and obtain the coefficients of the ERK methods with high weak stage order, follow these steps:
- Clone the repository. Inside the cloned repository, you will find a folder named 'Convg_Plot_From_Data'.
- In the 'Convg_Plot_From_Data' folder, locate and run the notebook named 'Plot_Convergence_from_Data.ipynb'. This notebook will generate all the figures presented in the manuscript.
- To generate the data required for these figures, you can run various test cases provided in different folders with appropriate names.
- For information on all the newly discovered explicit Runge-Kutta Methods with high weak stage orders, refer to the 'ERK_Coefficients.md' file.
